Twitch bot

Before using this bot you need:
- Twitch oauth
- Twitch client id
- Nickname of the bot
- Prefix of the bot
- Channel you want the bot to be in

  With the ollama integration you'll also need:
  - Ollama
  - Model of your choice (In my case gemma2) use "ollama pull gemma3"
  - At least 15gb of disk space
  - Gpu that can run ai well like RTX 4090 24gb, during my testing i was running the bot with GTX 970 4gb which was a bit slow but did work as intended. Ollama supports multiple gpus so don't be shy about using multiple to run with the bot.
